# Neural Network with Backpropagation (From Scratch)

A lightweight implementation of a feedforward neural network built entirely from scratch using `numpy`.

## Overview

This project was created for learning and experimentation purposes. It includes:

- Manual implementation of forward and backward propagation
- Basic training loop
- No frameworks — just raw `numpy`

## Disclaimer

This codebase is not intended for production or reuse. It’s purely educational and may lack robustness or optimization.
