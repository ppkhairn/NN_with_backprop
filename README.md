# Neural Network with Backpropagation (From Scratch)

A lightweight implementation of a feedforward neural network built entirely from scratch using `numpy`.

## Overview

This project was created for learning and experimentation purposes. It includes:

- Manual implementation of forward and backward propagation
- A neural network implementation from scratch using only NumPy.
- Educational, minimal design

## Installation

```bash
pip install nn-with-backprop-pk
```

## Disclaimer

This codebase is not intended for production or reuse. Itâ€™s purely educational and may lack robustness or optimization.
